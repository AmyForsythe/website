This series of tutorials were produced during a working group hosted by the Living Data Project, lead by Jennifer Sunday and Joey Bernhardt.

They are based on Canadian open datasets with accompanying R code that can be used to teach/illustrate ecological and evolution concepts, and are designed to illustrate and support exploration on a variety of core concepts aimed for undergraduate courses in ecology and evolution.
